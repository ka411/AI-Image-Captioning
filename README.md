AI Image Captioning â€“ CNN + LSTM

This project is an end-to-end deep learning solution for automatically generating captions for images. It combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for sequence generation.
